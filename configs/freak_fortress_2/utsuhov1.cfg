		// flags
		// 0x0001 - use RELOAD instead of ALT-FIRE to arm the bomb (generally not recommended)
		// 0x0002 - if a pyro airblasts the projectile, it explodes immediately (and if the explosion radius + damage are enough, it'll kill the pyro)
		// 0x0004 - only play the looping sound once per rage
		// 0x0008 - Apply m_bGlowEnabled to all mercenaries during the rage. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.
